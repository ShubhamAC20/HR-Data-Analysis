# HR-Data-Analytics

1.Designed a Power BI Dashboard to track employee data for the HR team, including working hours, attendance, performance and leaves. The dashboard streamlined HR processes and increased efficiency. 

2.Started by filtering out garbage or redundant date using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). 

3.The next step was to combine Data From Multiple Worksheets In the Same Excel Workbook using Power Query Editor. 

4.Used DAX Queries to do the initial visualization, mainly the COUNT() function to create measures such as the total working days, days people were present, and so on.

5.This dashboard was created with the help of Power BI, Dax, MS-Excel & Power Query Editor.
